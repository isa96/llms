        "content": "For nearly six decades, Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett has been dazzling Wall Street with his investing prowess. Since becoming CEO in the mid-1960s, the Oracle of Omaha, as he's best known, has overseen a greater than 4,450,000% aggregate return in his company's Class A Shares (BRK.A), as of the closing bell on January 12.\n\nWarren Buffett has a knack for picking long-term winners, and investors of all walks usually wait on the edge of their respective seats to see what he and his investment team have been buying and selling. The funny thing is, Buffett's most commonly purchased stock isn't the one you might initially think it is. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nBuffett and his team have been adding to a handful of brand-name stocks with frequency\n\nThe good news for curious investors is that Berkshire Hathaway is required to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission no later than 45 days following the end of each quarter. A 13F provides an under-the-hood look at what Wall Street's brightest minds purchased and sold in the previous quarter and is a required filing for persons and entities with at least $100 million in assets under management.\n\nAs of the closing bell on Jan. 12, Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio had $361 billion of invested assets spread across roughly 50 stocks. Some of these stocks have been added to with frequency in recent years.\n\nEnergy stockOccidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY) is the perfect example of a now-core holding that's had the undivided attention of the Oracle of Omaha and his \"investing lieutenants,\" Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, over the past two years.\n\nWhen 2022 began, Berkshire Hathaway held $10 billion in Occidental preferred stock yielding 8% annually. However, it held no common shares. As of this past week, Buffett's company owned a little over 243.7 million shares of Occidental Petroleum common stock, representing a greater than $14.1 billion stake.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe reason Buffett and his investing aides have purchased shares of Occidental with frequency over the past two years likely has to do with the expectation that the spot price for crude oil will remain elevated or head even higher. Multiple years of capital underinvestment by global energy majors during the pandemic, coupled with uncertainty tied to Russia's ongoing war with Ukraine, has led to a tight global supply of crude oil. Generally speaking, when the supply of a key commodity is constrained, it's not unusual for the spot price of that commodity to increase.\n\nOccidental Petroleum is unique among integrated oil and gas operators in that it generates a disproportionate percentage of its revenue from its upstream (i.e., drilling) operations. If the price of crude oil rises, Occidental will enjoy an outsized benefit. Of course, the opposite of this scenario (a decline in the spot price of crude oil) is true, as well.\n\nWarren Buffett has also not been shy about increasing his company's position in tech stock Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Since Berkshire's initial stake in Apple was opened during the first quarter of 2016, it's grown to almost 915.6 million shares and accounts for 47.1% ($170.2 billion) of invested assets.\n\nConsidering that Buffett referred to Apple as \"a better business than any we own\" during Berkshire's 2023 annual shareholder meeting, it shouldn't surprise anyone that he and his team have been building this position for years. Apple brings brand power and innovative consistency to the table that few other businesses can match.\n\nFor instance, Apple has been absolutely dominant in the U.S. smartphone market for well over a decade. Since introducing a 5G-capable iPhone in the fourth quarter of 2020, the company has consistently accounted for a little over half of U.S. smartphone market share.\n\nApple is also evolving into a platforms company. Placing added emphasis on subscription services is a way to boost long-term margins, minimize sales fluctuations during major iPhone upgrade cycles, and keep customers loyal to its ecosystem of products and services.\n\nThere's also nothing quite like Apple's capital-return program. Apple is returning $15 billion in dividends to its shareholders each year\u00a0and has repurchased more than $600 billion of its common stock since kicking off its buyback program in 2013. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWarren Buffett has bought shares of this stock on a nearly monthly basis for over five years\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's 13F is an invaluable tool that helps investors get a read on what stocks, industries, and trends are piquing the interest of Warren Buffett and his lieutenants. However, it doesn't tell the full story -- at least with regard to Warren Buffett's favorite stock to buy.\n\nThough there are a couple of core holdings in Berkshire's portfolio that have been purchased with frequency in recent years, there's another stock you'll find listed toward the end of Berkshire's quarterly reports that's been purchased by Warren Buffett on an almost monthly basis, dating back to July 2018. The reason you're not going to find this stock listed on the company's 13F is because Buffett's favorite stock to buy is his own company, Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nAs of the midpoint of 2018, Berkshire Hathaway's share repurchase program required the company's stock to trade at or below 120% of book value (i.e., no more than 20% above book value) for buybacks to take place. For many years leading up to July 2018, Berkshire's stock never fell to this line-in-the-sand threshold -- which meant not a cent was spent on repurchases.\n\nEverything changed on July 17, 2018. The company's board passed new measures that allowed Warren Buffett and his late right-hand man Charlie Munger more freedom to pull the trigger on buybacks when they saw fit. As long as Berkshire Hathaway had at least $30 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and Treasuries on its balance sheet, and Buffett and Munger agreed that their own company's stock was intrinsically cheap, repurchases could be conducted without any cap.\n\nSince Berkshire Hathaway's board made this change -- Berkshire hasn't reported its fourth-quarter results yet, which is why I'm stating this figure through Sept. 30, 2023 -- Buffett and Munger OK'd share buybacks in all 21 quarters. In fact, there have only been a handful of months over the past five-plus years where share repurchases didn't take place. In aggregate, Buffett and the late, great Charlie Munger oversaw the repurchase of more than $72 billion worth of Berkshire Hathaway stock since mid-2018.\n\nShare buybacks are the direct way Warren Buffett and his team reward long-term shareholders. Since Berkshire doesn't pay a dividend, regularly buying back stock can steadily increase the ownership stakes of longtime shareholders.\n\nFurthermore, companies with steady or growing net income, like Berkshire Hathaway (sans the recognition of unrealized investment gains and losses), should see their earnings per share climb as the number of outstanding shares decline. This helps to make Berkshire's stock even more attractive to fundamentally focused investors.\n\nIn 2024, there's no stock I'm more confident we'll see Warren Buffett buy than his own company.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Berkshire Hathaway wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures tick higher, pointing to an extension in gains posted in the prior session. Elsewhere, the U.S. Congress passes a bill providing short-term funding to the federal government, while department store chain Macy's (NYSE:M) reportedly plans to axe thousands of jobs and close some locations.\n\n1. U.S. futures move higher\n\nU.S. stock futures edged into the green on Friday.\n\nBy 05:16 ET (10:16 GMT), the Dow futures contract had risen by 73 points or 0.2%, while S&P 500 futures had gained 18 points or 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 futures had inched up by 114 points or 0.7%.\n\nThe major averages on Wall Street surged on Thursday, boosted in part by the largest one-day jump in shares of iPhone maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in eight months. TSMC's U.S.-listed shares spiked as well after the chipmaker said soaring demand for artificial intelligence will power a more than 20% rise in 2024 revenue.\n\nStrong U.S. labor market data also bolstered confidence that the world's largest economy was on track for a so-called \"soft landing\" -- a scenario in which inflation is cooled without sparking a downturn in activity. These hopes helped brighten sentiment, which had been dampened recently by waning expectations that the Federal Reserve will soon move to bring interest rates down from more than two-decade highs.\n\n2. Existing home sales ahead\n\nMarkets will have the chance to sift through fresh housing market data on Friday that could provide a glimpse into the health of the U.S. consumer.\n\nExisting home sales are expected to have risen by a seasonally adjusted 0.3% in December when compared to prior month, according to a Wall Street Journal survey of economists. Over the entire year, the measure is seen dipping to its lowest level since 2008.\n\nMortgage rates in the U.S. were elevated throughout much of 2023, persuading many buyers to shy away from purchasing residential properties. Meanwhile, the higher mortgage rates also convinced many current homeowners to stay put, denting the housing supply and limiting declines in home prices.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut mortgage rates, which touched a 23-year high in October, have showed signs of cooling. On Thursday, Freddie Mac reported that the average fixed-rate 30-year mortgage dropped to its lowest mark since last May this week.\n\n\"This is an encouraging development for the housing market and in particular first-time homebuyers who are sensitive to changes in housing affordability,\" said Freddie Mac Chief Economist Sam Khater in a statement. \"However, as purchase demand continues to thaw, it will put more pressure on already depleted inventory for sale.\"\n\n3. U.S. Congress passes short-term funding bill\n\nCongressional lawmakers have given the go-ahead to a bill that will keep the federal government in business until March, although looming policy fights still remain over issues like the war in Ukraine and U.S. border security.\n\nThe U.S. Senate approved the measure in a 77-18 vote, while the House approved it 314-108. The bill now goes to President Joe Biden's desk for signing.\n\nA replay of recent short-term funding extensions, Thursday's resolution will provide the funding necessary to operate several key departments until March 1 and the rest of the government until March 8. They were due to run out of cash on Jan. 19 and Feb. 2, respectively.\n\nBut leaders on Capitol Hill still face the task of securing funding for an almost $1.7 trillion U.S. spending deal forged earlier this month. The details have yet to be determined, with the Biden administration and Democrats potentially needing to agree to more funding to help curb immigration at the southern U.S. border in order to secure Republican backing for military aid to Ukraine.\n\n4. Macy's to slash jobs, close stores - reports\n\nMacy's is set to reduce headcount and shutter locations in a bid to cut costs and streamline its business, according to media reports.\n\nThe U.S. department chain will slash 2,350 roles -- amounting to 3.5% of its workforce -- and close five stores. Macy's employed 94,570 full- and part-time employees and operated 722 store locations as of January 2023.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, which was the first to report on the plans, said that Macy's is aiming to further automate its supply chain and outsource some jobs. In a memo to employees cited by the WSJ, the company said the layoffs would happen on Jan. 26.\n\nMacy's is facing heavy pressure from activist investors, who have reportedly set their sights on a $5.8 billion buyout of the owner of Bloomingdale's stores and Bluemercury beauty shops. The firm, which is also in the midst of a leadership change, has yet to respond publicly to the activists.\n\n5. Crude on pace for weekly gains\n\nOil prices rose on Friday, putting them on course for a positive week that has been fueled by geopolitical tensions as well as disruptions in U.S. oil production from a winter storm.\n\nBy 05:17 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 0.8% higher at $74.51 a barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 0.7% to $79.64 per barrel. Both benchmarks are on course for weekly gains of between 1% and 2%.\n\nCold weather has shut-in around 40% of oil output in North Dakota, a top oil-producing U.S. state, supporting the overall market, while tankers continued to be diverted away from the Red Sea due to violence in the region.\n\nAlso helping the market was data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration which showed a larger-than-expected draw in crude inventories of 2.5 million barrels, although gasoline and distillate inventories increased to multi-year highs.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nU.S. futures rise, Congress avoids government shutdown - what's moving markets\n\nIMF says Sri Lanka still needs deals with official and external private creditors\n\nAnnual foreign investment flows into China shrinks first time since 2012",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.\u2019s long-awaited Vision Pro mixed-reality headset will finally be available for preorders on Friday, giving the company its first real taste of consumer demand for the $3,499 device.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBlinken\u2019s Return From Davos Was Delayed After Plane Broke Down YouTube and Spotify Won\u2019t Launch Apple Vision Pro Apps, Joining Netflix Pakistan\u2019s Army Strikes Back at Iran as Both Sides Urge Calm Airstrikes on Yemen Bring New Level of Chaos to Shipping in the Southern Red Sea Trump Asks Supreme Court to Keep Him on Colorado Ballot\n\nThe product goes on sale at 8 a.m. Eastern time via Apple\u2019s website and mobile app \u2014 ahead of the Vision Pro getting delivered to stores and consumers on Feb. 2. The purchasing process will be unique. Customers will need to use a recent iPhone or iPad to scan their head and, if necessary, provide a vision prescription.\n\nThough Apple typically doesn\u2019t comment on the sales performance of new products, the preorder process could provide some hints. If shoppers are quoted delivery times well beyond Feb. 2, it may suggest that either demand is strong or supplies are limited \u2014 or something in between.\n\nWall Street analysts are predicting a slow start for the device. UBS Group AG analyst David Vogt expects Apple to ship 300,000 to 400,000 units this year, generating as much as $1.4 billion. For a company that had sales of $383 billion last year, that\u2019s \u201cimmaterial.\u201d\n\nRead More: Apple Headset Lacks Blockbuster Buzz Needed to Energize Shares\n\nStill, the idea is to set the stage for something bigger. Apple is entering its first major new product category since the company began selling smartwatches in 2015, and the Vision Pro may take years to catch on. Apple will continue to refine the headset \u2014 making it cheaper and more comfortable \u2014 and find compelling applications for the device.\n\nIn the longer run, Apple could use a fresh moneymaker. The smartphone market has matured, and it\u2019s under particular pressure in China. The company\u2019s revenue has fallen for four straight quarters \u2014 its longest streak of declines in more than two decades.\n\nStory continues\n\nInitially, the Cupertino, California-based company only plans to sell the Vision Pro in the US, with launches in other markets coming in the months ahead. The company is eyeing the UK, Canada and China as some of the first other countries, Bloomberg News has reported.\n\nIt\u2019s a complex product to manufacture, which could limit early supplies. The dual 4K resolution displays in the headset, which melds virtual and augmented reality, have suffered production snags. But the fact that Apple has been ramping up manufacturing for months suggests that it will be able to satisfy initial demand. The company is also offering a 25% discount on the device for employees, signaling that supplies aren\u2019t too tight.\n\nInside Apple, executives are anticipating a strong opening weekend, with sales tapering off later. At $3,499, the Vision Pro is one of the priciest consumer headsets ever \u2014 about seven times more expensive than the latest device from VR market leader Meta Platforms Inc.\n\nThe Vision Pro also will be a hard product to share with family and friends. It requires a precise fitting process to ensure a good experience. The face scan is designed to determine the best light seal and strap size for users. The company has prepared 25 different light seals \u2014 a cushion that prevents light from seeping into the wearer\u2019s field of view \u2014 in addition to two straps. There also are prescription lens inserts, at an additional cost.\n\nAnd the headset may be hard for some people to wear for extended periods. In early testing, some users have found it to be too heavy.\n\nAnother concern that\u2019s cropped up in recent days is a lack of support from top streaming apps. Netflix Inc., Spotify Technology SA and Google\u2019s YouTube are opting not to release software for the device, at least at launch.\n\nBut Apple has carefully refined its sales pitch for the headset. When consumers try it out at Apple retail stores, they\u2019ll get a 25-minute demo, letting them get comfortable with the 3D experience that the company calls \u201cspatial computing.\u201d\n\nTo commemorate the launch, Apple executives Mike Rockwell and Alan Dye discussed the device in a Q&A shared with employees this week.\n\nA key focus, said Dye, was ensuring that the Vision Pro didn\u2019t have a closed-in feel \u2014 a complaint with VR headsets.\n\n\u201cFrom the onset, we all had concerns about people sitting with their eyes covered and disconnected from the world,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really became central to how we thought about the core principles of the product.\u201d\n\nThat led to the EyeSight system, which can show a wearer\u2019s eyes through a screen on the front of the Vision Pro. \u201cIt was a huge technical challenge to do this in a way that looks and feels natural,\u201d Rockwell said.\n\nApple also developed an interface that doesn\u2019t require handheld accessories. Instead, it tracks eye movement and hand gestures. Users control the device by looking at an on-screen item and pinching their fingers together to select it.\n\nOne of the biggest selling points may be how easy it makes collaboration, Rockwell said. Users in far-flung locations can feel like they\u2019re in the same place.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the closest thing to being there in person that you can possibly have,\u201d Rockwell said. \u201cIt changes the way you collaborate and is very different from videoconferencing as we know it.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Downfall of Diddy Inc.

On Friday, the world\u2019s most valuable chipmaker gained more than 6% in Taipei \u2014 its biggest gain in almost a year \u2014 after a near-10% climb in the US. Key suppliers Tokyo Electron and Advantest Corp. gained more than 5% in Tokyo. Together, they fueled a gain in semiconductor stocks from the US to Asia of roughly $165 billion, based on Bloomberg\u2019s calculations.\n\nTSMC\u2019s outlook offered much-needed reassurance to investors accustomed to a depressed market. The main chipmaker to Apple Inc. and Nvidia is budgeting capital expenditure of $28 billion to $32 billion and expecting revenue growth to return to at least 20% for the year. Executives also spent a lot of time talking about how the advent of AI should turbocharge the industry because of its immense computing needs.\n\nIn Europe, chip gear linchpin ASML Holding NV gained 4%, leading a broad regional rally that spilled over into US stocks including Nvidia and Intel Corp., driving the biggest gain in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index since Dec. 11.\n\n\u201cTSMC\u2019s confidence around near-term fundamentals appears to have improved significantly over the past 4 to 5 months,\u201d Wedbush analysts wrote. \u201cWe see this more bullish outlook as predicated upon some combination of optimism around a growing contribution from AI, better expectations for traditional end market trends in 2024.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nTSMC Gains as Outlook Points to AI-Fueled Growth: Street Wrap\n\nSigns of a recovery for the chipmaking sector have emerged in recent weeks.

TSMC is projecting revenue growth of at least 8% to $18 billion to $18.8 billion in the March quarter, versus expectations for around $18.2 billion.\n\nIt\u2019s now moving ahead with plans for chipmaking plants in Japan, Arizona and Germany \u2014 the first of which will begin mass production at the end of 2024 in a big boost to TSMC\u2019s global footprint.\n\nRead More: TSMC\u2019s Outlook Backs Hopes for Global Tech Recovery in 2024\n\nUncertainty persists. This month, fellow chipmaker Samsung Electronics Co. posted its sixth successive quarter of declining operating profit, as it weathered the impact of muted consumer demand in its own smartphone and memory businesses.\n\nQuestions also overshadow China, the world\u2019s largest computing, smartphone, internet and chip market.\n\nApple \u2014 long one of TSMC\u2019s most important customers \u2014 faced headwinds with its latest iPhone generation. Several analysts downgraded Apple on expectations of soft demand, and Jefferies has said the iPhone sales slump in China is likely to deepen.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc., which is poised to launch its Vision Pro mixed-reality headset on Feb. 2, is already envisioning future workplace applications for the device, including using it for surgery, aircraft repair and teaching students.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBlinken\u2019s Return From Davos Was Delayed After Plane Broke Down Pakistan\u2019s Army Strikes Back at Iran as Both Sides Urge Calm Apple to Sell Watches Without Oxygen Feature After Legal Setback Airstrikes on Yemen Bring New Level of Chaos to Shipping in the Southern Red Sea Nasdaq 100 Hits Record High in Tech-Fueled Rebound: Markets Wrap\n\nIn a video sent to employees this week, Apple executives Mike Rockwell and Alan Dye discussed the product\u2019s development, as well as potential growth areas for the still-nascent technology. Bloomberg News obtained a transcript of the conversation, which came just before Apple began accepting preorders for the Vision Pro on Friday.\n\nWhen asked about some \u201ccool\u201d ways that people could use the $3,499 Vision Pro, Rockwell cited health care, training and education as key areas.\n\n\u201cOftentimes, surgeons struggle to look at displays during procedures, where information is spread out,\u201d said Rockwell, the vice president in charge of the device. \u201cApple Vision Pro could bring all of that together and hopefully improve patient outcomes.\u201d\n\nSeparately, the company told employees in a memo Thursday that they\u2019ll be eligible for a 25% discount on the Vision Pro. That\u2019s less than the 50% markdown that Apple offered when the company launched its smartwatch and HomePod smart speaker \u2014 though those products didn\u2019t have as high a price tag. It would take the cost down to about $2,600, excluding taxes and options.\n\nEmployees also get $500 to spend on a Mac every three years, a credit they\u2019ll be able to apply to the headset. And Apple will reimburse the cost of prescription lenses for the product, according to the memo, which was seen by Bloomberg.\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based company has marketed the Vision Pro as a consumer device for gaming, video and communication. But Apple is looking for ways to broaden its appeal. Technicians or aircraft mechanics could use it to get \u201chigh-quality training in ways they\u2019ve never been able to experience before,\u201d Rockwell said.\n\nStory continues\n\nRockwell added that he\u2019s \u201cvery excited about what we can do in learning and education because it is another superpower of Apple Vision Pro.\u201d\n\nApple didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTwo of Rockwell\u2019s lieutenants \u2014 Dave Scott and Yaniv Gur \u2014 are investigating new applications for the Vision Pro. Scott was previously an executive on Apple\u2019s car team before briefly leaving to run a mobile MRI machine company. He\u2019s now in charge of finding ways for enterprises to use the headset. Gur, who used to run engineering for Apple\u2019s productivity apps, is overseeing potential education opportunities for the device.\n\nApple is betting that mixed reality \u2014 the melding of virtual and augmented reality \u2014 will eventually become a major source of revenue. But the hefty price will make it harder to win over consumers.\n\nSuccess of the Vision Pro also will hinge on third-party developers. Though Apple has lined up content from many big entertainment providers, including Walt Disney Co., others have balked at supporting the new device.\n\nNetflix Inc., Spotify Technology SA and Google\u2019s YouTube don\u2019t plan to offer Vision Pro apps for their services, forcing users to see their content through the device\u2019s web browser \u2014 a less immersive experience.\n\nRead More: YouTube, Spotify Follow Netflix in Snubbing Apple\u2019s Vision Pro\n\nApple hopes the headset\u2019s groundbreaking technology will help win converts.\n\n\u201cWe strived to make a product that was a tool, not a toy,\u201d Rockwell said. \u201cTo make a product for productivity or high-end entertainment, displays had to be exceptional, so we invested a lot in creating a new, uncompromising high-resolution display system.\u201d\n\n(Updates with more on Vision Pro plans starting in 10th paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Downfall of Diddy Inc.

        "content": "Apple plans to sell its Series 9 and Ultra 2 Apple Watches without blood oxygen sensors after a federal court denied its bid to continue sales while it appeals an import ban imposed on those watches due to a patent infringement dispute with medical monitoring technology firm Masimo.\n\nLast year, the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) ruled that Apple\u2019s blood oxygen sensors in those two smartwatches violated Masimo\u2019s patents. The USITC imposed an import ban that briefly\u00a0went into effect before it was temporarily halted during the tech giant\u2019s appeal before the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals and while it sought approval for redesigned Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches.\n\nMasimo noted in a court filing this week that U.S. Customs and Border Protection approved Apple Watches that were redesigned to exclude a blood oxygen sensor feature. The Federal Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday denied Apple\u2019s request to put the ban on hold during the appeal, meaning the company had to stop selling the smartwatches at the center of the dispute unless the blood oxygen sensor was removed.\n\n\"Apple\u2019s appeal is ongoing, and we believe the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit should reverse the USITC\u2019s decision,\" the company said in a statement provided to FOX Business. \"We strongly disagree with the USITC decision and resulting orders.\"\n\nCOURT REINSTATES IMPORT BAN ON CERTAIN APPLE WATCHES AMID PATENT DISPUTE Apple is to refrain from selling Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 devices with blood oxygen sensors while it appeals the ITC's ruling.\n\n\"Pending the appeal, Apple is taking steps to comply with the ruling while ensuring customers have access to Apple Watch with limited disruption. These steps include introducing a version of Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 in the United States without the Blood Oxygen feature. There is no impact to Apple Watch units previously purchased that include the Blood Oxygen feature,\" Apple explained.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nApple noted that the redesigned Apple Watches became available from the company\u2019s retail website starting at 6 a.m. Pacific Time on Wednesday, and its retail stores also began selling them on Wednesday.\n\nStory continues\n\nCustomers who buy the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 will still see the blood oxygen icon on the watch, but when tapped they will receive a message saying, \"The Blood Oxygen app is no longer available. Learn More in the Health app on your iPhone.\" When users tap through to the Health app, users will see \"unavailable\" for Blood Oxygen and a link to a support article, Apple explained.\n\nAPPLE BOARD MEMBERS AL GORE, JAMES BELL TO RETIRE Apple is to sell its Series 9 and Ultra 2 smartwatches without blood oxygen sensors following the federal appellate court's ruling.\n\n\"The Federal Circuit\u2019s decision to lift the temporary stay is a victory for the integrity of the American patent system and the safety of people relying on pulse oximetry,\" said Joe Kiani, founder and CEO of Masimo, in a statement provided to FOX Business.\n\n\"It affirms that even the largest and most powerful companies must respect the intellectual rights of American investors and must deal with the consequences when they are caught infringing others\u2019 patents,\" Kiani added. Apple Watch Series 9 smartwatches are displayed.\n\nSeries 9 and Ultra 2 Apple Watches that were purchased before the restriction on the blood oxygen sensor technology was put in place are unaffected by the ban, and other Apple Watch products are similarly not affected.\n\nThe two smartwatches at the center of the dispute remain available for sale with the blood oxygen sensor to customers outside the U.S., where the U.S. International Trade Commission doesn\u2019t have jurisdiction.\n\nOriginal article source:Apple Watches go on sale without blood oxygen sensor amid patent dispute",

YouTube, like Netflix, is recommending that customers use a web browser if they want to see its content: \u201cYouTube users will be able to use YouTube in Safari on the Vision Pro at launch.\u201d\n\nSpotify also isn\u2019t planning a new app for visionOS \u2014 the Vision Pro\u2019s operating system \u2014 and doesn\u2019t expect to enable its iPad app to run on the device, according to a person familiar with matter. But the music service will still likely work from a web browser. Bloomberg News reported on Netflix\u2019s decision Wednesday.\n\nThe Vision Pro will include access to Apple\u2019s apps for music and podcasts, which compete with Spotify\u2019s offerings. But getting snubbed by Netflix, Spotify and YouTube means that the most popular streaming apps won\u2019t be available when the headset launches on Feb. 2. Apple has largely marketed the device as a platform for video, games and other entertainment.\n\nYouTube is a particularly large omission for the product. When Apple\u2019s original iPad launched in 2010, YouTube was one of a handful of apps preinstalled on the tablet.\n\nYouTube and Spotify continue to offer popular apps for the iPhone and iPad. And that, theoretically, gave them an easy path toward supporting the Vision Pro. Developers with iPad software in the regular App Store will see those apps appear in the Vision Pro store by default. That means developers have to opt out if they don\u2019t want to participate.\n\nStory continues\n\nSeveral other entertainment apps are still participating, including Disney+, Max, Peacock, ESPN and Amazon Prime Video. Altogether, Apple says the device will support more than 1 million titles in the headset\u2019s App Store. The company will begin taking preorders for the Vision Pro on Friday.\n\nYouTube and Spotify declined to say why they bowed out of supporting the $3,499 device. Spotify doesn\u2019t offer an app on competing headsets, such as Meta Platforms Inc.\u2019s Quest, though YouTube does. Spotify also has been embroiled in a fight with Apple over App Store policies, but the decision on the Vision Pro isn\u2019t related to that, according to the person familiar, who asked not to be identified because the deliberations are private.\n\nSearches conducted by MacStories on Thursday indicated that other key iPad apps, including Meta\u2019s Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, aren\u2019t currently set to work on the Vision Pro either. But that could change by the device\u2019s launch, or those developers could be planning new dedicated versions for visionOS.
